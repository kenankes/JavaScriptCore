We can use JavaScript in Web Development, GameDev (Unity) and also in mobile app development (Apache Cordova).
For large scaled business applications, there is a superset of JS which is called TypeScript.
JS can also be used to create full-fledged applications for Windows and Mac desktops via Electron.
You can create web servers, web APIs and other services using Node.js.
JS is a multiplatform language !

You need to install npm in your directory. To do so => run "npm init --yes" in command. This will create a package.json file. You can add ->
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "lite-sever"
  },
 "devDependencies": {
    "lite-server": "^2.6.1"
  }
    to your json file. Then run "npm install". This is necessary to execute your script.
